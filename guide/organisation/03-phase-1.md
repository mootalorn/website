# Phase 1 â€“ Preparing

*(4 - 5 months prior to the election)*

Organisation, planning and communication are paramount. You can use our guide and timeline as a
template, but be sure to adapt it to your circumstances.

- Let your institution decide: Do you want to run an election compass?
- Who is going to manage everything? This person doesn't have to and in fact shouldn't do everything
  alone, but it is very beneficial, to have a single person feeling responsible, that everyone else
  completes their assignments on time.
- Write down your own timeline. Get a tool to organize your team, like a kanban board or a
  todo app.
