# Phase 7 â€“ Evaluating the Answers

*(1.5 - 2 months prior to the election)*

You now have a lot of theses and even more answers. Quite possibly a very large amount of work. The
next step is to select the most important theses. You can do this in another workshop or in your
team.

- Go through every thesis and decide, wether it should become part of the election compass. Ask
  yourselves:
  - Is this thesis controversial enough? Meaning: is it helpful in telling the parties apart?
  - Is this thesis still relevant? The focus of the political debate might shift quickly.
- At this stage, around 25 - 40 theses remain. To few and the results loose accuracy. To many and it
  will take too long for the voters to process them.
- Let your political experts read the answers. Do they get the feeling, that some parties might have
  misunderstood a thesis? If so, talk to them and maybe rephrase the thesis (without altering the
  meaning, of course).
