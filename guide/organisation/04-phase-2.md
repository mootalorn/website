Of course, you can not do this all on your own. To succeed, you need experts, advisors and
supporters.

  - a Marketing Specialist, managing your marketing channels (e.g. social media, email, etc.)
  - a Web Developer with technical skills to get the election compass online
  - a Media Designer
  - some political scientists for advice (e.g. teachers or students)
  - some social scientists for advice (e.g. teachers or students)
  - enthusiastic citizens / people with good connections to the administration, newspapers and
    other institutions
  - someone with great language skills (for wording and spelling)
- Think of people that might fit into these positions and contact them.
- Organize a kick-off meeting of your entire team to present your project, the plan, the structure
  and timeline.
- Establish your organization tools and communication channels.
- Get everyone to work, gather todos and assign them, set deadlines.
