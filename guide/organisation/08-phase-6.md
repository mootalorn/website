# Phase 6 â€“ The Positions

*(after the workshop)*

Now it is time to let the parties answer and position themselves.

- Send the theses to every party. Until we have a tool to collect answers, use an online form!
- Make sure to also collect the logos (see the [Technical
  Guide](../technical/configuration.html#parties-logo)).
- Give the parties 2 - 5 weeks to answer, depending on your timeline.

In the meantime, prepare to publish the election compass.

- Prepare your media assets, take and collect photos, etc.
- You might want to prepare a stand on a public place or similar.
- Contact media outlets and tell them about your story.
- Contact the administration and ask them if they are willing to put a link on their website.
- Contact schools, teachers, youth organizations and sport clubs and ask them if they are willing to
  share some graphics and a link with their followers.
- You know someone who is a well-known member of society or has some other form of influence and
  followers? Get them involved, too.
