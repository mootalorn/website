# Phase 10 – Observe

Everything is up and running? Good! The only thing left to do now, is get your election compass into
as many hands as possible.

## After the election

Only a few things are left to do:

- Gather your team and reflect! Write down what you learn.
  - Did you enjoy the project?
  - Do you think it was a success?
  - Would you do it again? And if so, what would you change?
- Collect feedback from everyone else and write down what you learn.
  - What did the newspapers write?
  - Send a feedback form to the parties.
- Archive the election compass. You can delete it of course, but if you can, just keep it online. It
  can still be a valuable resource of transparency.

## A last request: Please give back to this project!

The OpenElectionCompass is free to use and open source and there are many ways you can help our
mission:

- **Write a blog post for us:** Tell others about it! For example: write a text about your personal
  experience and send it to us so we can publish it here. If you can, attach photos.
- **Feedback:** Did something not work as expected? This can be a technical problem or a
  recommendation in this guide. [Please give us feedback](https://forms.gle/dZ6Hwdp2GGX8s4VeA)!
- **Technical support:** You happen to be a Web Developer yourself and want to get involved? Please
  do! There are many big and small things that can be improved with your help.
- **Financial support:** We want the project to grow and this will require a continuous flow of
  money. While we try to keep everything cost-effective, you can always support us financially.
  Using the OpenCollective platform, you can make one-time or recurring donations – every amount is
  greatly appreciated. You can also see how we are spending your money.
