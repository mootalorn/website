# Phase 8 â€“ Time for a Test

*(6 weeks prior to the election)*

By now, you should have everything you need. Let's run a test!

- Feed your theses, answer and logos to the [Configurator](../configurator/version-1/language-file.html) to create the configuration file (also see
  the [Technical Guide](./technical.html)). Or write the configuration yourself, although that takes more technical
  background.
- Send the configuration file to your Web Developer and ask them to deploy the election compass to
  some sort of 'staging environment'. A staging environment will only be accessible from certain
  places or by a complicated URL or even a password.
- You can now take a look at the result. Try it out, give it to your team and the people that
  participated in your workshop(s). Gather their feedback.
- Make small adjustments until everything is ready for the big day!
