# Rules

::: danger Attention
Be aware, that **you are acting against the explicit intention and conviction of this project if you
are not following the rules in this section**. Violating these rules can damage the reputation of
the project and is greatly discouraged. If you want an election compass but are unable to follow
these rules, you can surely find a suitable institution that can.
:::

1. The supreme rule: **Use the power of an election compass for the democracy – never against it.**
Provide real, educational value for your fellow citizens and not for a person, group or party alone.

2. **Don't provide an election compass if you're a single person.** An election compass should
always be run by an organisation to be reputable.

3. **Don't provide an election compass if you're biased.** We all have our political opinions,
but an election compass should **never** be an instrument for political campaigns. It has to be
independent in any way (financially, politically, emotionally). If you are a political party, find
an independent institution and ask them to run the election compass!

4. **Every party** that participates in the election **should get the fair chance to participate**
in the election compass as well.

5. Treat everyone **equally, professionally and with respect** – every party or candidate. It goes
without saying, that racism, sexism and facism have no place in a democratic project.
