# Guide

## Introduction

An election compass is a wonderful tool to help educate young and old about democracy. It is a great
way to get everyone more involved in the election and can help to make politicians more transparent.
It is simple to use, yet no simple to build. To help everyone run their own election, we wrote this
guide on how to organize your own election compass. **With your feedback, it will grow over time!**

Make sure to also read the [Technical Guide](./technical.html).

## Rules

::: danger Attention
Be aware, that **you are acting against the explicit intention and conviction of this project if you
are not following the rules in this section**. Violating these rules can damage the reputation of
the project and is greatly discouraged. If you want an election compass but are unable to follow
these rules, you can surely find a suitable institution that can.
:::

1. The supreme rule: **Use the power of an election compass for the democracy – never against it.**
Provide real, educational value for your fellow citizens and not for a person, group or party alone.

2. **Don't provide an election compass if you're a single person.** An election compass should
always be run by an organisation to be reputable.

3. **Don't provide an election compass if you're biased.** We all have our political opinions,
but an election compass should **never** be an instrument for political campaigns. It has to be
independent in any way (financially, politically, emotionally). If you are a political party, find
an independent institution and ask them to run the election compass!

4. **Every party** that participates in the election **should get the fair chance to participate**
in the election compass as well.

5. Treat everyone **equally, professionally and with respect** – every party or candidate. It goes
without saying, that racism, sexism and facism have no place in a democratic project.

## General tips

1. Be transparent.
2. Communicate early and often.

## Phase 1 – Preparing (4 - 5 months prior to the election)

Organisation, planning and communication are paramount. You can use our guide and timeline as a
template, but be sure to adapt it to your circumstances.

- Let your institution decide: Do you want to run an election compass?
- Who is going to manage everything? This person doesn't have to and in fact shouldn't do everything
  alone, but it is very beneficial, to have a single person feeling responsible, that everyone else
  completes their assignments on time.
- Write down your own timeline. Get a tool to organize your team, like a Trello board or a
  To-Do-App.

## Phase 2 – Gathering your team (4 months prior to the election)

Of course, you can not do this all on your own. To succeed, you need experts, advisors and
supporters.

- Start with a list of people you need. This might include:
  - a Marketing Specialist, managing your marketing channels (e.g. social media, email, etc.)
  - a Web Developer with technical skills to get the election compass online
  - a Media Designer
  - some political scientists for advice (e.g. teachers or students)
  - some social scientists for advice (e.g. teachers or students)
  - enthusiastic citizens / people with good connections to the administration, newspapers and
    other institutions
  - someone with great language skills (for wording and spelling)
- Think of people that might fit into these positions and contact them.
- Organize a kick-off meeting of your entire team to present your project, the plan, the structure
  and timeline.
- Establish your organization tools and communication channels.
- Get everyone to work, gather todos and assign them, set deadlines.

## Phase 3 – Getting the parties on board (after building your team)

It is important, to get the parties attention. Normally, one party alone has no choice but to
participate. You wouldn't want to be the only party missing! But if multiple parties are
uninterested, you have a serious problem. You should not run an election compass with some parties
missing (one or two small parties might be tolerable).

- Select a date at least a part of your team is available (in about 2 - 3 weeks).
- Find a suitable room with a projector.
- Send out invitations to all parties participating in the election.
- Ask for a meeting and give them a rough idea what you are planning (now the reputation of your
  institution plays it's part).
- When meeting the parties, you can use the following agenda:
  1. Welcome everbody
  2. Present your idea
  3. Present your team
  4. Inform them about the timeline and what will happen next
  5. Listen to their feedback and take time to answer their questions
  6. (Hopefully) get their approval and support!
  7. Get some contact details
- After the meeting, send them the most important information and thank them for participating.

## Phase 4 – Preparing the workshop (2 weeks prior to the workshop)

The theses for your election compass obviously can not be written all by yourself. They need to
represent the society as a whole. The choice of theses decides over the quality of your election
compass. You need to get this right! Your theses need to cover the most important matters for the
next legislature. They need to be objective and impartial. The wording of the theses has to be
simple enough to understand and to the point. Take this task seriously, it is the most important
and the most difficult.

To achieve theses of good quality, you should run a workshop with a sample of your audience:

- Gather a group of young and first-time voters (now the teachers in your team will come in handy).
- If you like, you can also gather voters of all ages.
- Make sure, the group is representable for your audience! No gender, race or religion should be
  excluded!
- Set a date and find a large enough room with a projector – maybe a class room?
- Send out invitations and gather replies. Your group should have about 20 - 30 members.
- Get the political programms of all participating parties.
- With the help of your experts, gather topics of policital interest from the programmes and
  newspapers and sort them into categories (e.g. Social, Environment, Work, Traffic, Infrastructure,
  Energy, Economy, Finance, Tax, Security, etc.).

## Phase 5 – Work out your theses in a workshop (3 months prior to the election)

Use the topics and information of Phase 4, to conduct a workshop with your team and your group of
voters. In this workshop, you will work out a number of theses.

- Plan the workshop: what methods are you going to use? Teachers will be very helpful here!
- What materials will you need? Whiteboards, Pens, Paper, etc.
- How many theses do you need? Most election compasses gather around 50 to even 100 theses (for
  whole countries) at this stage.
- It will take you a few hours at least. Take care of your guests with pauses, lunch, snacks and
  coffee.
- Collect all theses in a list and don't forget to work on the wording.
  - Can the thesis be easily understood by everyone?
  - Might the wording be biased?
  - Does the wording match our style?
  - Is this a good length?

## Phase 6 – Collect the positions (after the workshop) and prepare for going public

Now it is time to let the parties answer and position themselves.

- Send the theses to every party. Until we have a tool to collect answers, use an online form!
- Make sure to also collect the logos (see the [Technical Guide](./technical.html)).
- Give the parties 2 - 5 weeks to answer, depending on your timeline.

In the meantime, prepare to publish the election compass.

- Prepare your media assets, take and collect photos, etc.
- You might want to prepare a stand on a public place or similar.
- Contact media outlets and tell them about your story.
- Contact the administration and ask them if they are willing to put a link on their website.
- Contact schools, teachers, youth organizations and sport clubs and ask them if they are willing to
  share some graphics and a link with their followers.
- You know someone who is a well-known member of society or has some other form of influence and
  followers? Get them involved, too.

## Phase 7 – Evaluate the answers (1.5 - 2 months prior to the election)

You now have a lot of theses and even more answers. Quite possibly a very large amount of work. The
next step is to select the most important theses. You can do this in another workshop or in your
team.

- Go through every thesis and decide, wether it should become part of the election compass. Ask
  yourselves:
  - Is this thesis controversial enough? Meaning: is it helpful in telling the parties apart?
  - Is this thesis still relevant? The focus of the political debate might shift quickly.
- At this stage, around 25 - 40 theses remain. To few and the results loose accuracy. To many and it
  will take too long for the voters to process them.
- Let your political experts read the answers. Do they get the feeling, that some parties might have
  misunderstood a thesis? If so, talk to them and maybe rephrase the thesis (without altering the
  meaning, of course).

## Phase 8 – Time for a test (6 weeks prior to the election)

By now, you should have everything you need. Let's run a test!

- Feed your theses, answer and logos to the [Configurator](../configurator/version-1/language-file.html) to create the configuration file (also see
  the [Technical Guide](./technical.html)). Or write the configuration yourself, although that takes more technical
  background.
- Send the configuration file to your Web Developer and ask them to deploy the election compass to
  some sort of 'staging environment'. A staging environment will only be accessible from certain
  places or by a complicated URL or even a password.
- You can now take a look at the result. Try it out, give it to your team and the people that
  participated in your workshop(s). Gather their feedback.
- Make small adjustments until everything is ready for the big day!

## Phase 9 – Going public (4 - 5 weeks prior to the election)

About a month before the election, you should publish your election compass.

- Tell the Web Developer in advance!
- When the election compass is online, tell everyone!
  - your team and participants from the workshop(s)
  - your own followers (you should post it first, so others can share your post easily)
  - the parties
  - the newspapers
  - the administration
  - your other partners
  - friends and family

## Phase 10 – Observe

Everything is up and running? Good! The only thing left to do now, is get your election compass into
as many hands as possible.

## After the election

Only a few things are left to do:

- Gather your team and reflect! Write down what you learn.
  - Did you enjoy the project?
  - Do you think it was a success?
  - Would you do it again? And if so, what would you change?
- Collect feedback from everyone else and write down what you learn.
  - What did the newspapers write?
  - Send a feedback form to the parties.
- Archive the election compass. You can delete it of course, but if you can, just keep it online. It
  can still be a valuable resource of transparency.

## A last request: Please give back to this project!

The Open Election Compass is free to use and open source. At the moment, we are not looking for
donations, though that might change in the future. You can always help us in simple ways:

- **Write a blog post for us:** Tell others about it! For example: write a text about your personal
  experience and send it to us, so we can publish it here. If you can, attach photos.
- **Feedback:** Did something not work as expected? This can be a technical problem or a
  recommendation in this guide. Please give us feedback!
- **Technical support**: You happen to be a Web Developer yourself and want to get involved? Please
  do! There are many big and small things that can be improved with your help.
