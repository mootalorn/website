# Generate Language File <Badge text="beta" type="warning"/>

This configurator generates language files (in JSON format) for you. All your input is **persisted
in your browser** so you can pick up where you left at anytime â€“ as long, as you don't clear your
browser storage / history. Notice, that while the OpenElectionCompass is multilingual, this
configurator generates the JSON configuration for **one language at a time**.
